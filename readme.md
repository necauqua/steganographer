This is a small CLI tool I wrote in Rust as part of a competition
with my friend, with whom we later extranged messages hidden in
images to test if our implementations matched.

It is slightly unfinished (cannot change the number of overriden bits
from CLI although the code is prepared for it) and also never released
on crates.io.

We did this a while ago, pushing it to GitHub now for it to be seen
to people who've read "I have some random Rust projects on my GitHub"
from my resume heh.
